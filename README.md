# Edit Dojo - LandingPage
A web app to improve writing skills in any language.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this came from the lack of these kind of resources. You can find a ton of resources to master reading, listening or speaking a language. But when it comes to writing, there simply aren't much. 

## How it works
The app will function in these steps:
1. A user A will sign up with 2 languages, one in which they are proficient(say, English) and the other which they want to learn(say, Japanese).
2. Then they will write anything they need in, say, Japanese.
3. A user B, who is proficient in Japanese, will then verify and propose corrections.
4. Similarly if someone wants to learn English, user A can verify their messages.
5. Everyone is happy.
